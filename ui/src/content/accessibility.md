# Accessibility

We’ve designed our website to meet the Australian Government standard for web accessibility.

Our website aims to meet the Australian Government’s web accessibility requirements. These include the World Wide Web Consortium’s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.0 (WCAG 2.0)</a> at level AA.

We want to provide our information for everyone, including people with a disability.

Please <a href="#footer-feedback">send us feedback</a> if anything on this site is inaccessible to you or you experience problems accessing our content.
