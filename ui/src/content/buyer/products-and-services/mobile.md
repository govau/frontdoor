We established the Mobile Panel for government buyers looking to buy mobile handsets and broadband devices.

The Standing Offer Notice (SON) for Mobile Panel is <a href="https://www.tenders.gov.au/Son/Show/ae876f92-bb7a-6ba8-d65a-f4024fabaf23" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">SON2589631</a>.

The current expiry date for the Mobile Panel is 31 August 2020. After this date, you will be able to purchase mobile products and services from the Hardware Marketplace and Telecommunications Marketplace. We will let you know when this occurs.
