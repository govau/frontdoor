We established the Software Marketplace for government buyers looking to source software products and services.

The Standing Offer Notice (SON) for the Software Marketplace is <a href="https://www.tenders.gov.au/Son/Show/90c61f3b-be27-3313-bcd6-93db777921c7" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">SON3490955</a>,

This SON includes:

- Category 1: the [whole-of-government sourcing arrangement for Microsoft](/buyer/products-and-services/sourcing-arrangements/microsoft/) products and services. This is separate from the Software Marketplace.
- Category 2: Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) software and services you can buy from the Software Marketplace.
