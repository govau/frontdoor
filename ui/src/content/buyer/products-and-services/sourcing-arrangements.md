# Whole-of-government sourcing arrangements

We established whole-of-government arrangements to make it easier for Australian Government agencies buy digital products and services commonly used across government.

They are put in place to:

- maximise market benefits
- deliver efficiencies and savings
- provide benefits and pricing not previously available for smaller agencies.

These arrangements only apply after you conduct a formal approach to market.
