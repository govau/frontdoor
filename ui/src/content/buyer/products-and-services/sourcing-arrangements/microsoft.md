We established a whole-of-government arrangement with Microsoft to make it easier for Australian Government agencies to buy Microsoft products and services.

Whole-of-government arrangements cover goods and services that are commonly used across government. They are put in place to:

- maximise market benefits
- deliver efficiencies and savings
- provide benefits and pricing not previously available for smaller agencies.

This arrangement only applies after you:

- conducted a formal approach to market
- selected Microsoft as the provider of your required products and services
