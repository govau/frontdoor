Whole-of-government sourcing arrangements

We established whole-of-government arrangements to make it easier for Australian Government agencies buy digital products and services commonly used across government. 

They are put in place to: 
•	maximise market benefits 
•	deliver efficiencies and savings
•	provide benefits and pricing not previously available for smaller agencies.

These arrangements only apply after you conduct a formal approach to market.
