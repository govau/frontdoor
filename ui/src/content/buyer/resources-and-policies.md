## <span name="digital-policies">Digital Sourcing Policies</span>

There are four digital sourcing policies that help buyers to source digital products and services. The policies help at each stage of the sourcing journey to ensure that digital solutions meet contemporary needs and government sourcing practices drive competition and innovation.

The policies are mandatory for Australian Government buyers who are Non-corporate Commonwealth entities (NCE). Other agencies can use them to guide their procurement process.
