# Common probity concerns

## How should I respond to sellers who ask why they weren’t included in my early market research?

A common fear preventing digital sourcing practitioners from conducting early market research is that sellers who were not included in the research will feel they have not been treated fairly and may choose to make a complaint. We can prepare for such complaints so that if they occur, we’re ready with the relevant documentation to respond to them appropriately, with established non-discriminatory complaint-handling procedures, and in a timely manner.

Here are some tips:

1. Make sure you **document** every step of your early market research, especially **why** certain suppliers were contacted, and –if applicable--why certain suppliers were not contacted. Unless you have a very specific, niche need it is unlikely you will be able to engage with every seller in a particular market, so your documentation should include your initial planning around how many sellers you intend to include in your research.
2. Ensure that you have a good range of seller-types included in your early market research. This will help to show that you have cast a wide net and considered as many as you were able, commensurate with the scale, scope and risks of the activity.
3. Be transparent with sellers. If they do contact you, provide them with all the information you used to plan and conduct your early market research.
4. Use the potential reactions of other sellers as a barometer to check your probity and accountability. At each stage of your early market research, ask yourself if you would be prepared to share information about your activities with a seller who complained. If the answer is ‘no’, that is a good indication you might be crossing a probity line.
5. Be willing to listen and learn. Some sellers may just be annoyed that they were not included, but some may have reasons why not including them would limit your overall understanding of the market.
6. Make sure everyone knows that involvement in your early market research will not give any seller access to commercial advantages over other sellers.
7. Check over your agency’s complaint-handling procedures to see if there are any agency documents to help you log your process/activities and be prepared for any unhappy sellers.
8. Talk to your procurement team before you start your early market research to see what advice they can offer about planning for complaints.

## How do I avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest?

A **conflict of interest** occurs when, in the execution of our duties, we find ourselves in a position to have our thoughts or behaviours influenced (or appear to be influenced) by private or personal interests. These personal interests include both gaining an advantage and avoiding a disadvantage for ourselves or someone else.

For example, if you are conducting early market research in a market that your brother is a seller in, that could be seen as a conflict of interest as you might skew your results in a way that favours your brother’s company. Or, if your research uncovered emerging technology that you think might make your role redundant, you might not be able to be fair and unbiased in your reporting out of fear of disadvantaging yourself.

A potential conflict of interest does not mean the research needs to be scrapped. There are basically 3 ways to deal with a real, potential or perceived conflict of interest:

a. Limit involvement of identified people to control any conflict,
b. Remove involvement of identified people if it is determined that any involvement is too risky, or
c. Determine there is no conflict and document the rationale.

In your early market research, you need to recognise and deal with actual, potential and perceived conflicts of interest.

Here are some tips:

1. **Processes**<br/>
   The best way to handle a conflict of interest is to already have a process in place to manage it. Check with your procurement team about their conflict of interest processes. It will probably involve documenting any potential conflict (real or perceived) and deciding how it should be handled and who should be involved in dealing with it.

2. **Declarations**<br/>
   Ensure everyone involved is made aware of the activity, the parties involved and the scope. Everyone involved in early market research should make a Conflict of Interest Declaration – even if they have nothing to declare. This might include acknowledging that you know or have worked with a seller or have shares or other interests in a particular company.

3. **Transparency and Documentation**<br/>
   Get any potential conflict of interest out into the open, up font, prior to the activity commencing. Ensure you declare any and all real, potential or perceived conflicts of interest. A good practice is to also maintain a central ‘Probity Register’, which, among other things, documents declarations and how each are being treated.

You must refuse and record any bribes, ‘facilitation payments’ or other enticements that could be perceived as an offer of personal gain. Report all attempts to your manager, probity advisor and/or your procurement team – even if the offer was made innocently; it is better to have it reported and documented, than have it ‘come out later’ and cause potential issues.
