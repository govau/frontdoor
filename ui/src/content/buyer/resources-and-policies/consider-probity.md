# Consider probity

## What is probity?

The public sector is expected to undertake early market research activities in a manner consistent with transparency, probity and accountability; ensuring fairness and not limiting competition and innovation.

**Probity** is the complete and confirmed integrity of a process. In short, it is the evidence of ethical behaviour.

**Accountability** means that officials are responsible for the actions and decisions that we take in relation to our digital sourcing processes and for the resulting outcomes.

**‘Transparency’** involves making sure we’re taking steps to enable appropriate scrutiny of our market research (or other digital sourcing) activities.

As government agencies, we have an obligation to ensure our digital sourcing conduct is always probity-rich. If we have clear, visible and meaningful commitments to probity, then it encourages sellers to want to do business with us - now and in the future.

## How does probity factor into early market research?

Probity concerns are one of the primary factors affecting people’s confidence in conducting early market research.

If you do not consider probity during your early market research, you expose yourself to the risk of claims that your agency:

- did not treat sellers equitably
- were biased in your decision making
- improperly used your position
- accepted inappropriate hospitality, gifts or benefits from sellers
- created a conflict of interest
- excluded sellers for trivial, indefensible reasons

It is important to note that the obligations of probity and accountability should in no way stop an agency from undertaking early market research and engaging in reasonable discussion with potential suppliers for a new digital requirement. Rather, early market research gives us an opportunity to demonstrate to industry that we are undertaking due diligence and consultation before presenting a formal request to the market.

When making probity decisions, some things you should consider include:

### Consistency

In order to best ensure that probity and accountability obligations are upheld, the process used to gather information from industry and the information collected should be consistent. You should also ensure consistency in how you document the information. This also enables the information to be accessible to public authority in the future.

### Complexity

Individual procurements may require different approaches to probity; one size will not fit all. If you are dealing with a particularly unusual or complex procurement and are uncertain about how probity should be factored into it, reach out to experts either within your agency or externally.

For large scale or risky activities, many agencies opt to engage an external probity officer to assist with their early market research. This person will be involved throughout the entire process and will help to provide advice to ensure your actions and communications are equitable. They are can also help with any complaints that may arise from unhappy sellers. Talk to your procurement team if you’d like to engage a probity advisor during your early market research.

### Inclusivity

Probity should be used to facilitate discussion of current approaches to market with suppliers in order to promote genuine engagement. Probity processes should be designed to enable innovative approaches to be adopted if required, and to support a level playing field so that relevant smaller sellers have the opportunity to engage as much as the big players.

### Use of information

Whatever method is chosen to undertake market research, it is critical that there is no element of formal bidding, actual or perceived conflict of interest, or commitment or undertaking towards any potential seller. Careful consideration must be given to using potentially sensitive information or a seller’s intellectual property to inform a formal procurement process.

Any information you receive from sellers must be treated in-confidence and only used for the intended purposes. If this information is required to be disclosed (for example, following a request from a parliamentary committee), reasonable notice in writing must be given to the seller from whom the information originated.

In early market research, sellers may be sharing commercially sensitive information about their products and services with you, including pricing, capabilities and what they see as their competitive advantage. Make sure you take appropriate steps to protect this information – both from other sellers, and from internal resources who are not part of the market research activity.
