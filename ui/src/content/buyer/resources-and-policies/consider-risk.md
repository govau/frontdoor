# Consider risk

## How can I reduce the risks associated with early market research?

Many risks of the early market research and engagement process will be addressed if these principles are considered:

- **Uniformity**: While no two sellers are alike, engagement with all sellers consulted should be as uniform and consistent as possible.
- **Security**: If information is provided by a seller, it should not be shared with other sellers (directly or inadvertently) or people outside of your agency unless explicit permission from the seller is attained. Any documentation provided by sellers should be stored securely.
- **Boundaries**: You and your staff should be open with sellers about what can and cannot be discussed. The purpose of the early market research must be clearly communicated to sellers to avoid any misunderstanding.
- **Recordkeeping**: Sound recordkeeping is vital to document that an agency’s probity and accountability obligations have been adhered to. Records of your early market research should include who you have engaged with, the reason for the engagement, the activities conducted and any actions resulting from the engagement.
- **Planning**: You should take time before engaging in early market research to plan your research approach, factoring in the four points above. It is generally more expedient (and less stressful) to prevent a problem than to fix it.

## How does early market research reduce risk later on?

Early market research provides a firm foundation for future sourcing activities and supports the development of robust procurement documentation. Amongst other elements, this reduces the risk of issues such as:

- Poorly designed specifications
- A lack of tender responses
- Unsuitable conditions of contract
- Inferior value-for-money outcomes

## Will early market research commit me to a particular seller?

Early market research should only involve pre-procurement activities and is separate from any formal digital sourcing processes. Ensure you are clear and upfront with sellers about your intentions and that no promises made of any future procurements or contracts as a result of the activity.

Early market research does not lock you into any particular seller or any specific digital sourcing solution; it is just a first step to seeing what’s out there, exploring possibilities, and realistically gauging the capacity for the industry to contribute to your outcome.
