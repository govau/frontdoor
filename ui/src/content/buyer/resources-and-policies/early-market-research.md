Early market research describes a range of activities through which agencies consult with industry to gain information about digital products, services and solutions outside of a formal procurement process. The research may inform a future procurement activity, but it is intended to be an exploratory exercise and usually does not involve commercial commitments. It can be formal and complex or as simple as searching the internet or making a phone call.

Early market research can also be referred to as market sounding, or industry engagement.

Early market research is a valuable research tool to inform any future procurement activity. It gives agencies the opportunity to challenge their assumptions about a
particular industry, clarify industry capabilities and determine the most appropriate sourcing strategy. The aim is to increase knowledge and understanding about particular industry as a whole rather than the merits of individual sellers.

## What are the benefits of early market research?

Early engagement with industry provides government agencies with valuable information to make any subsequent procurement process more refined and efficient, reduce risk, and ultimately deliver improved contract outcomes. It also benefits industry as sellers are not investing unnecessary time and effort in responding to unclear or uninformed formal market approaches.

The information agencies gather through early market research helps them to:

gauge market capability and capacity to meet a need
gain a better understanding of industry trends as well as new and innovative solutions to government challenges
be more flexible and outcomes focused in their digital sourcing
consider market intelligence in relation to the aims of a larger program before that program commences
better mitigate risks through informed forward planning
align our sourcing strategies with the market
find better matches between our needs in government and industryâ€™s capabilities in meeting those needs
encourage engagement with new and emerging sellers; and
help the market make the most of government business opportunities and drive their own innovation
