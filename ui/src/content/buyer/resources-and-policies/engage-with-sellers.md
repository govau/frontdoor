# Engaging with sellers

## Where can I find information about potential sellers?

You can find information about potential sellers in a variety of ways:

- Search widely-used panels, such as the DTA’s Hardware, Software or Digital Marketplaces, or your home agency’s panels for names of sellers that can meet your needs.
- Use Austender (or a state government equivalent, for example, QTenders, NSW eTenders, etc.) to find other panels that offer a particular type of service or technology, then search those panels for likely sellers.
- Tap into industry and other research and data holding bodies (for example: Gartner or IBISWorld)
- Attend relevant events, such as conferences and tradeshows, showcases, workshops and networking sessions
- Participate in seller and supplier visits/tours, product demonstrations and site/facilities inspections
- Engage with advisers, industry experts and industry forums or groups
- Revisit previous procurement and agency records and documents – both internally and across government
- Talk to stakeholders that have conducted similar research or procurements
- Undertake internet research to get a broad idea of who the players in the market are and identify any new players that were not captured in your existing research

## How do I shortlist sellers?

Once you have an initial list of potential sellers, spend some time conducting further research on them in relation to the specific requirements of your project – remembering to remain outcomes focused, rather than product or solution focused.

Consider the scale, scope and sensitivity of your activity and take some time to identify and document the related risks. Engage with appropriate internal stakeholders and document your initial desktop research. This can all assist in navigating to a defensible list of potential suppliers which you would like to pursue further discussions with.

Consult with the broadest range of sellers possible to ensure that a range of different perspectives are considered.

Remember to document your activity for future justification of why you chose to speak to the sellers you selected.

## Do I need to contact sellers already on panels?

Not necessarily.

Early market research can involve more than the existing sellers on panels. The idea is to discover new trends, new technologies and innovative solutions including international offerings. That is not to say, however, that existing sellers and suppliers can’t offer you services in a new way or in a new area, so it’s likely that you will involve existing suppliers, but there is no rule that they have to be involved and consulted.

## What are my options for actually talking to sellers?

Much of your early market research engagement will be informal and should involve a gradual learning journey that progressively builds knowledge from your research phase.

Informal conversation with industry can feel confronting. You might worry that sellers will be purely focused on selling you products, or that you will open yourself up to probity or bias issues. To alleviate this, it is advised to spend time formulating your questions and begin each conversation by setting clear expectations. You might want to do this via an introductory email.

In your introductory email or conversation, you should clearly state what you are looking for and what the potential outcome of the engagement will/won’t be. Be honest and don’t mislead suppliers. Make sure they understand that their involvement in your early market research does not guarantee them any commercial gain and that any information you share with them will be shared broadly with the industry. If your department is not going to do anything after the early market research (apart from issuing an internal report), tell this to sellers; they will then understand that there is no sales opportunity (and it will help them to stop pestering you).

It is important to be polite, but be aware that politeness and/or discomfort can prompt you to make vague statements that could be misinterpreted as promises or open-door invitations. By being clear and up-front, you give sellers the opportunity to decline to be involved, which is better than making them feel you have wasted their time when their involvement does not lead to a commercial outcome. Note that you should treat all sellers the same in your early market research, as differences in treatment would contravene fairness and transparency principles and undermine confidence in the digital sourcing process.

Your agency may have an internal approval process you need to undertake before you start contacting sellers, so be sure to check your agency’s internal policy.

## How does early market research impact my engagement with existing suppliers?

Conducting early market research should not inhibit standard ‘business as usual’ with existing suppliers, so long as you maintain clear boundaries around the discussions you have with those suppliers. An incumbent supplier can also be part of your early market research so long as you do not discuss anything with them that could give them a potential advantage (whether real or perceived) for them over another seller.

It is very important that you have a clear end point for your early market research and communicate that clearly with all sellers involved.

## Can I meet sellers for lunch or a coffee?

It is often thought that meeting sellers for an informal chat over coffee might cause probity issues, but as long as you tell the seller you will report the meeting to your manager (and you follow through with that) and make a record of the meeting, you will have protected yourself and your research.

The most pressing issue here is making sure you have not accepted any inappropriate gifts or hospitality. This is sometimes viewed as a tricky one — what does ‘hospitality’ mean? Your agency will have clear guidelines on accepting hospitality, but a good rule of thumb is: when in doubt, don’t. Even when the offered hospitality is likely of minimal monetary value, such as a light lunch in a seller’s Head Office to discuss a project, it would not be appropriate for you to accept as it could be perceived as an enticement that could influence your decision to move the procurement forward with this seller. You should politely decline the offer and arrange to meet the potential provider in your office.

Face-to-face chats with sellers over coffee can be a good way to keep early market research discussions light and informal, but keep in mind how many meetings you have and who is paying for the coffee. Accepting one coffee is unlikely to cause a conflict of interest in how you carry out your duties. However, receiving regular coffees can quickly amount to considerable monetary value, which may be perceived as influencing how you deal with these suppliers. Ideally, you should ensure that you pay for your own coffee at every meeting, and ensure you spend equitable time with all the suppliers on your shortlist. It is worthwhile reiterating to the seller during the meeting that you are in the early market research phase and are not guaranteeing the seller any work whatsoever.

Receiving unsolicited calls is also fine so long as you document and report the call.

## How do I ensure my early market research benefits sellers?

Early market research is outcomes focussed — that means we acknowledge that we are not the experts, and we let the market tell us what’s possible instead of working in a vacuum. However, you may feel that engaging with industry without any commitment to buy from them is a waste of their time.

Early market research benefits industry in many ways. It creates space for open dialogue between agencies and industry, so sellers can better inform us of industry capabilities, emerging technologies and new solutions. Complex, innovative or high-risk programs can then be adapted to better utilise industry capacities and position sellers to better meet the needs of such programs. This also greatly assists in meeting internal stakeholder expectations around budget and cost.

By talking openly and early to industry in a digital sourcing process, we give them time to adjust and meet the future demands of government. This is particularly useful when requirements cannot be adequately met by existing technology or service offerings; sellers can identify market gaps and innovate to fill unmet government needs.

Conducting early market research also provides an opportunity for industry to be informed about government digital sourcing processes, which is particularly relevant in sectors where suppliers may lack experience in completing government tenders. Through this research, we educate the market and confront any preconceptions regarding transacting with agencies.

It is important to communicate clearly and honestly with sellers about the research you are conducting. Make sure they understand that their involvement in your early market research does not guarantee them any commercial gain and that any information you share with them will be shared broadly with the industry. By being clear up-front, you give sellers the opportunity to decline to be involved, which is much better than making them feel you have wasting their time when their involvement does not lead to a commercial outcome.
