# Other considerations

## How might an external resource help me?

External resources include specialist contractors or consultants as well as knowledgeable and experienced colleagues from within other areas of your agency. You may also be able to seek advice and input from staff at other agencies that you have met during the course of your career or through networking events.

External resources can offer specialist experience and knowledge that you or your agency may not currently possess. These specialists can provide varying levels of assistance, from offering advice to managing the whole early market research process.

Here are some things to consider when using an external resource for this early stage of industry research:

- External resources can only advise you on what they see as the best options based on their personal knowledge and experience, and what they are told by you, your agency and industry. They are not the final authority on a subjectâ€”their opinion, while educated, is still an opinion.
- The business risk of the program as a whole remains with the agency commissioning the resource.
- External resources who offer advice, or who manage the process on behalf of the agency, must be impartial.
- As much as possible, you and your staff should take steps to learn from the external resource. Knowledge transfer is an important added value of using an external resource and can, over time, prevent your agency from becoming too reliant on external support.

## When should early market research end?

Early market research is considered to be a planning activity. The process should cease when the your agency has developed a strong enough understanding of the market to confidently proceed to a formal Approach to Market (or have determined that the digital sourcing process will not proceed).

It is very important that you have a clear end point for your early market research and communicate that with all sellers involved.
