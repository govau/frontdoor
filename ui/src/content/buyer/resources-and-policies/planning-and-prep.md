# Planning and preparation

## Do all projects need early market research?

Not all projects require early market research, but if you can answer ‘yes’ to any of these questions, then you should consider it.

- Is there doubt over the existence of a market for the identified business need or product?
- Assuming there is a market of some kind, are there doubts over its capacity, capability, maturity or competitiveness?
- Is first-hand, in-house agency knowledge of the market superficial, incomplete or simply absent?
- Is there uncertainty about the level of seller interest in your outcome?
- Is the desired outcome likely to involve significant business change within your agency?
- Is your agency requirement unusual or novel?
- Is the solution to your requirement likely to be complex or innovative?

Early market research is not appropriate for every situation, but where it is, it should begin at the earliest possible stage in the digital sourcing process to assess the reaction of the market, the proposal required, and the digital sourcing approach.

## Shouldn’t I just use a panel?

Panels are a great resource for early market research. They can help you identify appropriate sellers to approach to inform your activity. Some panels offer features to assist you with your early market research, such as the ‘Ask the Market’ option on the Digital Marketplace.
However, one thing to consider is that panels may overlook new sellers, sellers offering emerging technologies, or even international sellers. This is particularly relevant if your requirement is unusual or novel. If we want to invite innovative solutions, then early market research both on and off panels will return the best options to find something that suits your needs, offers value for money and can future-proof our agencies with the most up-to-date solutions and technology.

## What preparation do I need to do?

### Have a plan

Proper planning is necessary if early market research is to result in the desired outcome. Poorly planned early market research can result in inadequate outcomes for both your agency and industry, as well as unjustified costs in terms of time spent and resources allocated to the engagement. Your agency could also suffer from reputational damage if sellers feel that the early market research process was poorly facilitated.

### Do some initial research

There is no ‘one size fits all’ approach to planning an early market research process. Before contacting any sellers, it is generally advisable to begin with some ‘secondary research’ techniques and conversations with colleagues and in-house experts to gain a basic understanding of the market you are intending to engage with. This will help you determine the shape and scope of your research and identify gaps in agency knowledge, which the subsequent market research activity is intended to assist with.

### Be open and outcomes focused

Early market research should focus on gathering information about what is possible, not deciding on a solution. Discussions should centre on the ‘ends’ rather than the ‘means’; the outcome you are seeking rather than what you think the detailed requirements of the final solution are/will be. You will have ample opportunity during the formal procurement process to specify requirements – don’t preclude the possibility of discovering new perspectives and opportunities by narrowing the focus of your research to solutions you are already aware of.

### Think about the information shared and received

Before initiating contact it is important to understand what information you want to share with industry, what information is required from industry, and what questions need to be raised. This will help ensure that you are the one driving the direction of the engagement. If industry sets the parameters of the discussion, there is a risk that the information attained will be akin to a ‘sales pitch’, which may not be beneficial in terms of broadening your knowledge of the industry or clarifying your requirements.
It is important to communicate clearly and honestly with sellers about the research you are conducting. Make sure they understand that their involvement in your early market research does not guarantee them any commercial gain and that any information you share with them will be shared broadly with the industry. By being clear up-front, you give sellers the opportunity to decline to be involved, which is much better than making them feel you have wasted their time when their involvement does not lead to a commercial outcome.
