# Tips for success

When conducting early market research;

## Do…

- Plan your actions well from the very beginning. Think about your objectives and a process to achieve them
- Conduct preliminary desktop market research about the industry and the particular sector you are interested in before speaking to any sellers
- Consult your agency guidelines on early market research and engage appropriate stakeholders to assist (such as your sourcing team)
- Consult with other agencies to find out if they may have done similar activities in the recent past, or if they are interested in collaborating on your early market research and/or subsequent procurement
- Consider the scale, scope and sensitivity of your activity and take some time to identity and document the related risks. This will help shape your potential seller list or guide you to a wider/open approach
- Be mindful of both the value and risk level associated with the kind of outcome you are seeking. More complex and expensive outcomes are likely to require a more structured and rigorous approach to market research
- Engage with sellers as early as possible
- Consult with the broadest range of sellers possible
- Document your actions and outcomes, including any face-to-face meetings and discussions with sellers
- Focus on outcomes, know your problem and ask suppliers to suggest a solution
- Manage supplier expectations and ensure they are very well informed about your early market research objectives and process, including engagement boundaries (particularly around any non-commercial / commercial aspects)
- Ensure that all identified sellers have the same opportunity to contribute to your early market research
- Speak to industry groups and professional associations, not only individual sellers

## Don’t…

- Share confidential or sensitive information obtained from one seller with other sellers
- Share any confidential or sensitive information obtained from sellers beyond those for whom it was intended
- Infringe a seller’s intellectual property rights
- Make any promises to sellers with regard to any future commercial opportunity
- Take any gifts or accept any benefits
- Focus on a particular type of product or service
- Disclose your agency’s commercial-in-confidence information
- Become reliant on information provided by one seller when designing your future procurements, so as not to advantage this one particular seller
