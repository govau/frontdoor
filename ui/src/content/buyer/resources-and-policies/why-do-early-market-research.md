# Why do early market research?

There are a number of reasons to conduct early market research and understanding these will help you to have a smooth procurement process in the future. Explore the ideas below.

## A rapidly changing landscape

Technology is evolving at an increasingly fast pace, and the digital industry is a rapidly changing landscape. When we work on large-scale or high-investment digital products and solutions, it’s important that we speak to people and companies who work in the area we’re interested in. This helps us ensure we are using the most up-to-date information to develop our approach to market documentation, mitigate risks and inform decision making.

## Be more strategic

By engaging with industry at an early stage, we can be more strategic and systematic in our dealings with sellers and the industry as a whole, rather than just engaging with them on a short-term, program-by-program basis. This benefits whole programs and not just individual projects.

## Rich data and deeper understandings

Early market research allows you to access rich sources of data and information from industry on the way a particular market operates, the types of services and products available, industry pricing structures and any future changes to the industry. It also gives us a deeper understanding of a particular category of goods or services — leading to the identification of initiatives aligned to business value drivers and value-for-money outcomes.

## Align requirements with industry capability

A key strategic aspect of early market research is that it can help you express your desired outcomes and translate them into high-level statements of business requirements. When these statements are aligned with industry capability it is much more likely that the desired outcomes will be achieved.
Early market research is an important dialogue between you and industry which is aimed at refining and aligning requirements for any future sourcing activity.

## Invite innovation

Early market research encourages us to focus on the requirements of our outcome rather than any pre-determined product. It supports a more flexible, outcomes-based approach to market. This also allows industry the opportunity to propose previously unknown and possibly innovative solutions.
There may be instances where industry doesn’t currently offer a solution to our need. In these cases, we need to revisit our requirements and scope, which can be done with minimal cost and effort if we have done our market research early.

## Robust documentation

Gaining a deeper understanding of an industry prior to a sourcing activity supports the development of robust procurement documentation relevant to the targeted industry. This reduces the need for addenda or post-tender clarifications later.
