# Privacy

The DTA is bound by Australian Privacy Principles (APPs). APP 5 says that we must tell you about collecting your personal information.

## The DTA’s Privacy Policy

Our Privacy Policy tells you what information we will collect about you, in what circumstances and what we will do with that information.

The term ‘personal information’ in this privacy policy means any information in which your identity is clear or from which it can be discovered.

We do not automatically collect personal information about you when you visit this website.

You can use this website without telling us who you are or revealing other personal information.

If you fill out our feedback form, you do not need to identify yourself or use your real name.

## What this policy applies to

This policy applies to the dta.gov.au website managed by the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA).

## How we collect and use your information

If you fill in a feedback or contact form on any of our pages we may collect the email address you provide and any other identifying information you include, such as a name or phone number.

Other than circumstances such as unlawful activity or serious threats to health and safety, we do not share personal information.

If you ask us about an issue that needs to be dealt with by another agency, we will provide you with the necessary details so that you can make contact with that agency yourself.

You may opt out of further contact from us at any time by emailing [info@dta.gov.au](mailto:info@dta.gov.au)

## How we protect your personal information

This site is hosted in Australia in secure, government-accredited facilities. To help protect the privacy of the data and personal information we collect and hold, we maintain physical, technical and administrative safeguards.

Access to your personal information is restricted to employees who need it to provide services to you.

## How we deal with complaints and requests

You can:

- request access to personal information about you that we hold
- request the removal of personal information about you that we hold. To the extent possible, with reference to the Archives Act 1983 (Cth), the DTA will comply with this request where it does not impact the ongoing utility of the Digital sourcing for government website and its related activities.
- ask us to correct your personal information if you find that it is not accurate, up-to-date or complete
- make a complaint about our handling of your personal information

To protect your privacy and the privacy of others, we will need evidence of your identity before we can grant you access to information about you or change it.

You can [contact us through our feedback form](#footer-feedback).
