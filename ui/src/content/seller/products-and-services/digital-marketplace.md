We established the Digital Marketplace for government buyers looking to source digital products and services.

The high-level objectives of the Digital Marketplace are to increase the participation of small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups. We do this by breaking down barriers to entry, delivering better sourcing outcomes through increased competition and delivering innovative solutions for government.

The Standing Offer Notice (SON) for Digital Marketplace is SON3413842.
