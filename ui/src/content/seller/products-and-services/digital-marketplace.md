We established the Digital Marketplace for sellers who offer digital consultants, contractors and advisory services to government buyers.

The high-level objectives of the Digital Marketplace are to increase the participation of small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and start-ups. We do this by breaking down barriers to entry, delivering better sourcing outcomes through increased competition and delivering innovative solutions for government.
