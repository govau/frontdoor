We established the Software Marketplace for sellers who offer software products and services to government buyers.

The Standing Offer Notice (SON) number for the Software Marketplace Panel is <a href="https://www.tenders.gov.au/Son/Show/90c61f3b-be27-3313-bcd6-93db777921c7" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">SON3490955</a>.

This SON includes:

- Category 1: the [whole-of-government sourcing arrangement for Microsoft](/seller/products-and-services/sourcing-arrangements/microsoft/) products and services. This is separate from the Software Marketplace.
- Category 2: Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) software and services you can sell on the Software Marketplace.

New sellers can apply to sell on the Software Marketplace during the next expected panel opening by mid-2020.

Once the panel opening is announced, the requirements and application process will be listed on AusTender. You can [[TODO]request to receive notifications from AusTender](#) when the request for tender (RFT) is released.

You can also keep an eye out for announcements on the <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/news-blogs/all" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">DTA blog</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/dta" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">DTA Twitter feed</a>.

While the panel is open on Austender, new sellers can apply by submitting a response to the tender.

If you are approved as a seller on the Software Marketplace, we will:

- send you Head Agreement with instructions for signature
- request user login details do we can create an account for the primary contacts in your company. They can then set up anyone else in the company with an account. This will help your company get familiar with the marketplace before you start selling.

You can start selling your products and services once you have completed the enrolment process which is:

- you received the DTA countersigned Head Agreement
- you create profiles for your business and users
- we load your sample products and services into the Software Marketplace

The list of approved sellers will be updated and displayed on Austender after:

- the RFT is closed
- the DTA has evaluated tender responses
- successful sellers are notified
- the contracts have been finalised by the DTA

This process may take up to 12 weeks.
