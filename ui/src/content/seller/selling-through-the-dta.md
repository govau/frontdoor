The Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) established panels and portals for sellers who want to sell digital products and services to government.

The Department of Finance offers general advice on <a href="https://sellingtogov.finance.gov.au/guide" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">selling products and services to the Australian Government</a>.

## <span name="understand-dta-panels-and-marketplaces">Understand DTA panels and marketplaces</span>

DTA panels consist of evaluated suppliers or sellers who offer digital products and services that government agencies commonly use. These panels allow you to sell digital products and services and enter into contracts under a standard set of terms and conditions.

Panels are set up to ensure government buyers follow <a href="https://www.finance.gov.au/procurement/procurement-policy-and-guidance/commonwealth-procurement-rules/" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Commonwealth Procurement Rules</a>.

We manage the following panels and marketplaces:

## <span name="before-you-join-a-panel">Before you join a panel</span>

When a new panel is being established or an existing panel is being refreshed, an announcement will be made on Austender. You can sign up for notifications from Austender if you have a particular panel in mind. We also announce panel openings on the DTA blog and Twitter feed for updates.

## <span name="while-the-panel-is-open">While the panel is open</span>

When a panel is established, there will be a period where it is open for sellers to apply to join the panel. Sellers are evaluated against a number of criteria to ensure they can supply the required goods and services to government. Panels also have refresh cycles where they re-open to update and refresh the sellers on the panel.

## <span name="dta-sourcing-platforms">DTA sourcing platforms</span>

Once you’re successful in joining a panel, you can start selling your products using:

- the <a href="https://ictprocurement.service-now.com/sp" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">ICT Procurement Portal</a> for digital products and associated services
- the <a href="https://marketplace.gov.au" target="_blank" rel="external noreferrer">Digital Marketplace</a> for digital contractors, consultants and advisory services

## <span name="winning-work-with-government">Winning work with government</span>

Once you are on a panel, you are able to bid for government contracts. To give yourself the best chance at winning government work we recommend to:

- keep your seller profile and catalogues on the platforms up-to-date
- have a senior or authorised contact available to respond at short notice
- update the content on your website with current information
- submit the latest version of required documentation
- be as clear as possible with your response to opportunities.
