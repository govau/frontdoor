## Before you join a panel

### How to work with government through panels
To apply for work with Federal government, sellers need to be part of a panel arrangement. A panel is used by government agencies to procure goods and services required. In a panel arrangement, a number of suppliers are selected who are able to supply identified goods or services to an entity.

When a panel is established, there will be a period where it is open for sellers to apply to join the panel. Suppliers are typically evaluated against a number of criteria to ensure they can supply the required goods and services to government. Panels also have refresh cycles where they re-open to update and refresh the sellers on the panel. Some panels, such as the Digital Marketplace, are available to join at any time. Others you will need to wait for their opening period before you can apply.

### How to prepare for a panel opening
When a new panel is being established or an existing panel is being refreshed, an announcement will be made on Austender. You can sign up for notifications from Austender if you have a particular panel in mind. We also announce panel openings on the DTA blog and Twitter feed for updates.

In the meantime, there are certain things you can prepare to make sure you have the best chance possible once the applications are open.

## Once you are on the panel

### Finding what products or services government is interested in

There are a few places you can look to figure out what types of digital products and services are in demand for government.
1. Check out the opportunities posted on the Digital Marketplace
2. Read agencies’ Annual Procurement plans

### Winning work with government
Once you are on a panel, you are able to bid for government contracts. To give yourself the best chance at winning government work you should:
1. Always keep your profile and contact information up to date on the relevant platforms. Many government buyers browse seller catalogues to find out more about the providers they are looking for.  
It’s also a good idea to keep your website information current and accurate.
2. Be as clear as possible with your response to opportunities.
