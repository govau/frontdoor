00:00:01.933 --> 00:00:05.233
You’ve noticed an opportunity
that’ll help your agency,

00:00:05.233 --> 00:00:09.133
but you need to integrate system X with system Y.

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:14.099
It’s an unusual project and no-one in your agency
has the know-how to advise you…

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.233
you’re not even sure if it is possible!

00:00:17.233 --> 00:00:20.833
You should approach your usual ICT or Digital Panels,

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.466
but keep in mind, depending on your need,

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.699
you might miss out on unknown,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.933
cheaper or better ways to reach your outcomes.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.499
Maybe there are sellers you don't know about

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.866
who have new technologies
or ideas to help solve your problem.

00:00:34.866 --> 00:00:37.232
You need to scan what’s out there

00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:39.599
by conducting early market research.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.700
This can be via existing panels
or you could cast a wider net

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.700
to capture those new sellers
and emerging technologies.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.466
Early market research means
you can talk to sellers on and off panels

00:00:53.466 --> 00:00:55.866
to discover possible options for your problem.

00:00:55.866 --> 00:01:00.299
Early market research is also
sometimes known as market sounding.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.333
It’s a way of discovering what
and who are out there in the ICT industry

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:09.333
that might help you achieve
your project outcomes.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:13.333
You’re not making any commitment to work
with particular sellers at this stage,

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:14.966
you’re just sounding things out.

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:18.499
Even if you don’t know what the solution is yet,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.566
early market research means you…

00:01:21.566 --> 00:01:24.366
Get a better understanding of industry trends.

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:28.366
Gain a broader and deeper view
of the capability of industry

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:31.866
Invite innovative solutions to your problems

00:01:31.866 --> 00:01:34.566
It might sound like a lot of effort…

00:01:34.566 --> 00:01:36.799
It might even sound risky…

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.200
But don't worry.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.900
We have resources and tips to help you
with each step of your early market research.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.066
So, how can we help?

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:48.032
We’ve developed a resource
through the sticky

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:52.066
(and not so sticky) parts of early market research,

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:55.966
from the planning stages
to the actual research,

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.366
with probity in mind along the way.

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:03.966
Probity is about integrity,
honesty and ethical behaviour.

00:02:03.966 --> 00:02:07.399
A lot of people may worry that
in early market research

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.900
sellers may argue that they were
not treated equitably or without bias.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.600
You might also worry about sellers
thinking you’re offering them work,

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.066
or that they may hassle you for work.

00:02:19.066 --> 00:02:22.432
But, it isn’t difficult to mitigate these concerns.

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:25.733
With the right templates and processes,

00:02:25.733 --> 00:02:29.099
you can do your early market
research with confidence

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.566
that you’re following the right approach,

00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:33.199
in-line with government rules.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.300
You’ll also have a smoother, shorter
or more streamlined procurement process,

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.766
as more effort earlier on,
will make it easier later.

00:02:41.766 --> 00:02:48.066
Much of this is about openness, transparency,
and documenting your processes,

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:52.799
and we’ve got a lot of info, advice
and templates to get you started.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.366
Don’t let your fears or worries
about early market research

00:02:57.366 --> 00:03:00.832
stop you from finding out what industry is up to,

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:05.499
and how new technologies or solutions
can help support your outcomes.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.933
So, ready to get started?
